Rainfall Prediction Assignment
Overview
This assignment focuses on building a machine learning model to predict rainfall using historical weather data. You will perform essential steps in a typical data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 🌧️

Dataset
The dataset contains daily weather observations from a specific region. The key columns are:
Date: The date of the observation.
TempAvgF: Average temperature in Fahrenheit.
DewPointAvgF: Average dew point in Fahrenheit.
HumidityAvg: Average humidity percentage.
SeaLevelPressureAvgInches: Average sea level pressure in inches.
VisibilityAvgMiles: Average visibility in miles.
WindAvgMPH: Average wind speed in miles per hour.
PrecipitationSumInches: Total precipitation (rainfall) in inches.

Assignment Tasks
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🧹
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values, if any, using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation).
Clean the data by converting columns to their correct data types.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
Generate descriptive statistics for the key numerical columns.
Visualize the relationships between different weather variables and rainfall using plots like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
Identify potential correlations that could be useful for the model.

3. Feature Engineering 🛠️
Create a new target variable, Rainfall, which is a binary classification (1 for rain, 0 for no rain). You can define a threshold (e.g., if PrecipitationSumInches > 0, then Rainfall = 1).
Engineer new features from existing columns if necessary (e.g., Month, Day_of_Week).

4. Model Building 🧠
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose a suitable classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for your task.
Train the model using the training data.

5. Model Evaluation ✅
Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix: A table showing correct and incorrect predictions.
